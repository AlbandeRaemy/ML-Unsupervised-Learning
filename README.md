# ML-Unsupervised-Learning

Apple, to better understand what push its target customers to buy its products rather than Windows, has decided to analyze its audience from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits and the Hult DNA. For this purpose, the company has commissioned a survey with many behavioral questions, as well as demographics and habits. In this analysis, we're taking into account the replies of the 137 Hult students from different programs that answered 77 questions.

We will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms (PCA and Clustering) to better understand what drives the purchase of one one brand of computer over another one and to help predict the purchasing behavior of the students based on demographics and psychographics.
Windows or Mac?


CASE:
Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.


Recently, Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, your team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors. Apple is looking forward to receiving your key insights, as well as an organized Jupyter Notebook that can be shared with their internal analytical teams. They also have sent you a kind reminder to utilize external research to support your findings and to give details related to details such as audience size.
